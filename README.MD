### Getting started:
1. Place the [YSM](YSM) folder in the `*game folder path*/mods` directory
2. For the first time and whenever you make changes to the files, run [GenerateMod.bat](YSM/GenerateMod.bat) to generate the mod files
3. The mod will now be available in the game


### Making changes:
Use your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to open the folder and manage all the files. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/). Every single change made to the mod is accompanied by a comment that says “Updated by YSM”, making it easy to locate any feature of the mod. For instance, you can make additional changes, merge the mod with your own, and use or post it together


### One more thing
You can find all the assets used for YSM in [YSM/GameData/Assets/2D/Interface/Common/YSM](YSM/GameData/Assets/2D/Interface/Common/YSM)
